__### Week One Python CODE CYSE 250__ 


## chapter 1

## _ExO 1_ 

```# Write your code here

name = "Isaac"
address = "Harrisonburg va"
phone = "(540 551 xxxx)"

print (name)
print (address)
print (phone)
```


## _ExO 2_

```# Write the code here
width = float(input ("Enter the width: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height: "))
area = width * height
print ("The Area is", area, "square units.")
```
## _Ex0 3_

```# Write your code here
width = float(input ("Enter the width: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height: "))
area = width * height
print ("The area of a this triangle is", area * .5, "square units.")
```
## _Ex0 4_

 ```# Write your code here

radius = float (input("Input Circle Radius: "))
currentrad = int(radius)
area = 3.14 * radius ** 2
print ("the area of a circle with a radius of",currentrad, "is", area, "square units")
```
## _Ex0 5_

```# Write your program here
width = float(input ("Enter the width: "))
height = float(input("Enter the height: "))
depth = float(input("Enter the depth: "))
volume = width * height * depth
print ("The Area is", volume, "cubic units.")
```

## _ex2-1_

Rounding formula to get an output to an exat decimal place


```
Roundnum = round(number to be rounded, to what dcimal place)
```
### example
`rounded_number = round(3.14159, 2)
print(rounded_number)`


## _ex2-2_

### Write code that will calculate the surface area of a cube

```# Write your program here
edge = float(input("Input Edge length"))

cubearea = ( (edge * edge) * 6)

print ("cube surface area is", cubearea , "square units")
```

_ex2-3_

~~~
# Write your program here
newbie = float(input("Enter new video count: "))
oldie = float (input ("Enter old video count: "))

tnewbie = (3.00 * newbie)
toldie = (2.00 * oldie)
# this section  (${:.2f}",format) rounds the output to two decimal points and adds a dollar sign
print ("${:.2f}".format(tnewbie + toldie))
~~~
### Note*
This section of code is what formats the output to round to two decimal places and adds a dollar sign to the front of the output.

`"${:.2f}".format`

Also you can round a variable to any amount of decimal places with this below code. the number is the amount decimal places

`rounded_variable = round(variable_to_round, 2)`


## **_ex2-4_**

```
# Write your program here

radius = float(input("Enter sphere radius: "))

diameter = (2 * radius)

circumference = (2 * 3.141592653589793 * radius)

surface_area = (4 * 3.141592653589793 * radius ** 2)

volume = ( 4/3 * 3.141592653589793 * radius ** 3)

#left these rounded values for future reference if round values are needed for these formulas
diameter2 = round(diameter, 2)

circumference2 = round(circumference, 2)

surface_area2 = round(surface_area, 2)

volume2 = round(volume, 2)

print (diameter)
print (circumference)
print (surface_area)
print (volume)
```

## **_ex2-5_**

### Simple code for calculating momentum

```

```

## **_ex2-6_**

### Incorporates code from ex2-5

```
# Write your program here
mass = float(input("Enter Object's Mass: "))
velocity = float(input("Enter Object's Velocity: "))

Momentum = (mass * velocity)

print ("The" , mass ," kilogram Object is traveling at a Velocity of: ", velocity , "meters per seceond, which would give its Momentum to be: ", Momentum)

KE = ( 1/2 * mass * velocity ** 2)

print ("The numerical representation of Kinetic Energy of the Object is: " , KE )
```


## **_ex-2-7_**

This excercise had issues where i needed to convert a float to an integer to not get an 0.0 error in python

```
# Write your program here
years = float(input("Enter how many years: "))


# this next line of code converts float to interger. 
# The round funtion without any switches will round to the nearest integer
yearsrnd = int(round(years))

minperyr = 525600

minperyrrnd = round(minperyr,0)

minelapsed = (minperyrrnd * yearsrnd)

print ("minutes elapased in time frame is:", minelapsed)
```

## **_ex2-8_**

# Code Breakdown: Number Guessing Game

This guide explains a Python program where the computer tries to guess a number based on user input. Let's break down the code step by step.

## 1. Getting User Input

The program starts by asking the user to provide two numbers: a smaller and a larger number.

```python
smaller = int(input("Enter the smaller number: "))
larger = int(input("Enter the larger number: "))
```

- `smaller`: The lower bound of the range.
- `larger`: The upper bound of the range.

## 2. Initializing Variables

Next, the program initializes three variables:

```python
count = 0  # Keeps track of how many guesses have been made
low = smaller  # The current lower bound
high = larger  # The current upper bound
```

- `count`: Tracks the number of guesses.
- `low`: Initially set to the smaller number.
- `high`: Initially set to the larger number.

## 3. Binary Search Loop

The core of the program is a **while loop**, which implements a binary search to guess the user's number.

```python
while low <= high:
    guess = (low + high) // 2  # Guess the middle of the current range
    count += 1
    print(f"{low} {high}")
    print(f"Your number is {guess}")
```

- **Binary Search**: The computer guesses the number by calculating the midpoint between `low` and `high`.
- The program prints the current bounds (`low` and `high`) and the current guess.

## 4. Getting User Feedback

After making a guess, the program asks for feedback from the user:

```python
user_input = input("Enter =, <, or >: ")
```

- `=`: The guess is correct.
- `<`: The guess is too high, so the computer will narrow the range by adjusting the upper bound.
- `>`: The guess is too low, so the computer will adjust the lower bound.

## 5. Adjusting the Range Based on Feedback

The program adjusts the bounds depending on the user's feedback:

```python
if user_input == "=":
    print(f"Hooray, I've got it in {count} tries!")
    break
elif user_input == "<":
    high = guess - 1  # Narrow the upper bound
elif user_input == ">":
    low = guess + 1  # Narrow the lower bound
```

- If the user enters `"="`, the program announces that it guessed the number and exits the loop.
- If the user enters `"<"`, the upper bound is set to one less than the guess.
- If the user enters `">"`, the lower bound is set to one more than the guess.

## 6. Cheating Check

If the loop exits and the bounds (`low > high`) are invalid, it means the user provided inconsistent feedback, and the program concludes they cheated:

```python
if low > high:
    print("I'm out of guesses, and you cheated!")
```

This handles the scenario where the user's feedback is impossible, i.e., the number can't be guessed within the provided bounds.

## Summary

This program uses a binary search approach to guess the number the user is thinking of. It adjusts the range based on the user's feedback (`=`, `<`, or `>`) until it guesses the correct number or determines the user is cheating.

### Key Concepts:
- **Binary Search**: Efficiently guessing numbers by halving the search range each time.
- **User Feedback**: Input-driven adjustments to the guessing logic.

**Chapter 4 presented an algorithm for converting from binary to decimal. You can generalize this algorithm to work for a representation in any base. Instead of using a power of 2, this time you use a power of the base. Also, you use digits greater than 9, such as A â€¦ F, when they occur.**

**Define a function named repToDecimal in the file convert.py that expects two arguments, a string and an integer. The second argument should be the base. For example, repToDecimal("10", 8) returns 8, whereas repToDecimal("10", 16) returns 16. The function should use a lookup table to find the value of any digit. Make sure that this table (it is actually a dictionary) is initialized before the function is defined. For its keys, use the 10 decimal digits (all strings) and the letters A â€¦ F (all uppercase). The value stored with each key should be the integer that the digit represents. (The letter 'A' associates with the integer value 10, and so on.) The main loop of the function should convert each digit to uppercase, look up its value in the table, and use this value in the computation. Include a main function that tests the conversion function with numbers in several bases. (LO: 5.2, 5.3)**

### Your tasks


#### Your goal is to create and thoroughly test a Python function named myRange. This function is to be defined in a file titled testmyrange.py. The purpose of myRange is to mimic the functionality of Python's built-in range function, but with a notable exception: instead of producing a range object, myRange will generate and return a list of integers. This exercise is designed to deepen your understanding of function parameters, control flow, and list operations in Python. It is crucial that you do not use the built-in range function in your solution.
Function Requirements

Parameters:
        The myRange function should accept three parameters. The first parameter represents the starting point of the range. The second and third parameters are optional; they represent the stopping point of the range and the step by which the range increments or decrements, respectively.
        Utilize a default value of None for the second and third parameters to indicate that they are optional.

Behavior:
        When the function is called with a single argument, treat this argument as the stopping point of the range, and set the starting point to 0. The step, in this case, defaults to 1.
        When the function is called with two arguments, treat the first argument as the starting point and the second as the stopping point of the range. The step defaults to 1.
        When the function is called with all three arguments, the first argument is the starting point, the second is the stopping point, and the third is the step.
        The function should produce a list of integers starting from the first argument up to, but not including, the second argument, incrementing by the third argument's value if the start is less than the stop. If the start is greater than the stop, the list should decrement.
        If the step is 0 or leads to an infinite loop (e.g., step is positive when the start is greater than the stop or negative when the start is less than the stop), the function should return an empty list.

Return Value:
        The function returns a list of integers calculated based on the arguments provided.

Hints

Begin by determining the actual values of the parameters based on the rules mentioned above. This involveshandling cases where some parameters are not provided (i.e., are None).
Next, use a loop to construct the list of integers. Pay careful attention to the direction in which you count(upward or downward) and ensure that your loop terminates correctly.
Consider edge cases, such as when the step is 0 or does not logically align with the start and stop values, toprevent infinite loops.

Learning Outcome (LO: 6.3)

Upon completing this task, you will have gained a deeper understanding of function definition, parameter handling, conditional statements, and loop constructs in Python. This exercise will also enhance your ability to translate complex requirements into working code.
Testing Your Function

After defining the myRange function, you are expected to rigorously test its functionality to ensure it behaves as expected. Implement a main function within the testmyrange.py file that calls myRange with various combinations of arguments and prints the results. Examples of test calls include:

    myRange(10)
    myRange(1, 10)
    myRange(1, 10, 2)
    myRange(10, 1, -1)

Use these tests to verify that your function handles different scenarios correctly. Remember, thorough testing is key to ensuring the reliability of your implementation.**

            If not provided, start defaults to 0 and stop to the provided value.
